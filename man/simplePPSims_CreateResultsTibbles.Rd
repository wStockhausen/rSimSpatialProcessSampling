\title{Create parent and cluster tibbles from simple point process simulation object}
\usage{
simplePPSims_CreateResultsTibbles(res)
}
\value{
Object of type "cluster_sim_tbl", a list with elements
"parents" and "clusters", each of which is a tbl_df object
with the first containing cluster parent locations by simulation and the second
containing the locations of the points in the clusters, by simulation.
}
\description{
Create parent and cluster tibbles from simple point process simulation object
}
\details{
The "parents" and "clusters" elements of the returned list are identical because
the cluster size for "simple" sims is 1 (the parent and "cluster" locations are identical).
}
